# Library App

This project aims to develop a user-friendly library app using Angular to address the challenges students face in accessing and managing the availability of books in the school library. 
The app provides real-time information on book availability, helps users locate books within the library, and facilitates effective planning of library visits.

## Features
- Quickly check the availability of specific books.
- Search for books by title, author, or subject.
- View real-time availability status and additional information such as shelf locations.
- Plan library visits based on book availability.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
